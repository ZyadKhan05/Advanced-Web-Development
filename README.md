LAB 3

Adding on to Lab 2. 

The Webpage includes the following:
  •	A sticky navigation bar with a logo, horizontally listed navigation menu, and hamburger menu that appears in its place when the window is resized to mobile or tablet
  •	Create a horizontal list group, each list item is a link to your contact page, home page, and about us page, and add to the navbar
  •	<div> sections need to become a Bootstrap card component
  •	Create a pop over that alerts the user they are about to leave the page upon hovering over an external link (enable pop-over in step 7 above)
  •	Make images responsive and centered on the page (using bootstrap classes) https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/content/images/
  •	Sort the table by clicking the column names & add Bootstrap table variants and make rows hoverable
  •	 Move the “comments” text box or text area to the contact page. The text still displays to the right of the box after the user clicks an “enter” button - use responsive block buttons. Use a floating label for the field label of comments
  • Breadcrumbs on all three pages, sticky navbar on all three pages
  •	Div items/cards need to flex, content inside needs to be centered vertically and horizontally, cards are same size on the page
